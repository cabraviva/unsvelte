# Here you can specify formatting commands for specific tanks
# If you haven't created any yet, use the main tank
# Every command will get run for every file
# To get the file name use ${filename}
# If your formatter does not support filenames, use @COPY [YOUR_COMMAND]
# This will run the command in a isolated directory only containing this file
# If you only want to execute a command once, use @ONCE [YOUR_COMMAND]
