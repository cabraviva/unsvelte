# Here you can define your agents
# If you want to read a full documentation about agents, look here: https://github.com/greencoder001/nautus#agents
# Agents help you recompile specific parts of your code when needed
# To create an agent create a file called @AgentName.js in this directory
# You can write it like a nautus script (see: https://github.com/greencoder001/nautus#using-scripts)
# If you want to have some boilerplate, you can use the nautus agent create command
# Here you can define which agent watches which tank, just take a look at the example
# and add your code when needed
